# Smol App

- install `nvm` and then run `nvm use` (alternatively manually install node.js >= 18.16.0)
- install pnpm: https://pnpm.io/installation
- install the netlify CLI globally so it's on your path: `pnpm install --global netlify-cli`
- run `ntl` to check it's working
- run `ntl init`, and you should end up linking the netlify site with our repo:

```
Directory Linked

Admin url: https://app.netlify.com/sites/smol-app
Site url:  https://smol-app.netlify.app
```

After you are setup, simply run `pnpm run dev` to start your dev server!
