        Daetherion has created a Filterblade module to enable
        <span class="text-primary-300"> automatic highlighting of bases </span>
        associated with unique orders from our order book!
      </span>

      <p>
        If you would like to have your own filter <span class="text-primary-300"
          >highlight bases from peepos orders</span
        >, you can do that through Filterblade, however you will need to re-sync
        your filter whenever you want to be up to date with orders. To do this,
        you can apply the Smol Requests Module to your filter, which is publicly
        available on filterblade here:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex gap-4 flex-wrap justify-between">
      <Image
        src={filterImage1Src}
        alt="logo"
        class="max-w-full sm:max-w-[45%]"
      />
      <Image
        src={filterImage2Src}
        alt="logo"
        class="max-w-full sm:max-w-[45%]"
      />
    </div>
    <p>
      To re-sync your filter, all you need to do is to re-load your filter with
      the Smol Requests module on it, and download or sync again.
