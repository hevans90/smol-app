      <p>This filter auto highlights unique base items from our order book!</p>

      <p>
        If you would like to run your own filter and still have the Smol App
        Order highlighting, you can still do that through Filterblade, however
        you will need to re-sync your filter whenever you want to be up to date
        with orders. To do this, you can apply the Smol Requests Module to your
        filter, which is publicly available on filterblade here:

    <div class="flex gap-4 flex-wrap justify-between">
      <Image
        src={filterImage1Src}
        alt="logo"
        class="max-w-full sm:max-w-[45%]"
      />
      <Image
        src={filterImage2Src}
        alt="logo"
        class="max-w-full sm:max-w-[45%]"
      />
